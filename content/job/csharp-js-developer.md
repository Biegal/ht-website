### We're looking for next Happy Developer!

Currently we have few open positions for Happy Developers!  
If you want to join us, do some work and have fun in the process, just send us your CV to <a href="mailto:careers@happyteam.io">careers@happyteam.io</a> and we will see where you fit!

***What we offer?***  
- Professional and respectful work atmosphere.
- Fully remote environment - you can work from anywhere!  
- You will get your personal budget for sharpening your saw (books, conferences, workshops - you choose, no questions asked)  
- Are you a conference speaker or want to be one? That's great! We fully support that, even financially!  
- Do you want to rent an office or coworking space? We will help here too!


***What do we expect from you?***  
Don't worry, you won't find list of acronyms and worthless certificates here.  
We look for open-minded professionals, not afraid to step up if they think it will benefit our customers. Those that are eager to learn new things and are not discouraged by failures.  
For currently open positions knowledge of C# and/or AngularJS will be advantage, but it's not a must.
